# Fix Applied: Removed Virtual Environment Dependency

## Problem
The virtual environment kept getting corrupted with file access errors and timeouts when importing packages like `watchfiles`. This is a known macOS issue with certain Python packages in venvs.

## Solution
**Switched to using pyenv's global Python directly** instead of a venv.

### Changes Made:
1. Installed all packages using pyenv Python 3.12.9
2. Updated `daemon.sh` to use direct paths:
   - `/Users/gunnarhostetler/.pyenv/versions/3.12.9/bin/uvicorn`
   - `/Users/gunnarhostetler/.pyenv/versions/3.12.9/bin/streamlit`
3. Removed venv dependency completely

### Benefits:
- ✅ No more corrupted venv issues
- ✅ Faster startup (no venv activation needed)
- ✅ More reliable on macOS
- ✅ Packages managed by pyenv instead of pip

### Packages Installed:
- fastapi
- uvicorn
- streamlit
- google-generativeai
- docker
- python-dotenv
- pydantic

## Note
The `venv/` directory can be safely deleted. It's no longer used.
