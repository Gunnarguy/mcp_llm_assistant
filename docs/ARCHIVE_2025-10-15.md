## MCP_UNDERSTANDING.md

**IMPORTANT: Core MCP architecture documentation**

This explained the critical distinction between MCP tools/resources/prompts and Notion's hierarchical structure. Key insights:

- Notion MCP server only exposes **tools** (API endpoints), not resources
- Must traverse hierarchy: search → get_page → get_children → get_database
- Query parameters broken in open-source makenotion/notion-mcp-server
- Official https://mcp.notion.com/mcp has working query parameters

**Migration Note:** This understanding is now embedded in copilot-instructions.md

---

## TESTING.md
